                        Tickets are the documents that confirm purchase and guarantee a seat on the airplane for the chosen journey. Tickets are required as a proof to get the boarding pass at the airport, which is needed in order to board the aircraft. The traditional tickets on the early days of air travel were made of paper and were to be collected from the travel agencies or airline office after purchasing. Along with globalization and the development of aviation industry, the process of ticket purchasing has also changed. Since the rapid growth and use of internet since the 2000s, ticket purchasing has been possible online.
